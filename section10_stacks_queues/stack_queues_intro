# stack: you can only get to the last item added
# queue: you can only get to the first item added

# stack: LIFO (last in, first out)
# queue: FIFO (first in, first out)

# stack in list you just use have to to add and remove form the same end
# queue in list you have to add to one end and remove from the other end

# stack is o(1) for adding and removing
# queue is o(1) for adding and removing if you use collections.deque

# * in queue you add on one end and remove from the other end
# * in stack you add and remove from the same end

# queue list
# remove and adding from the end is o(1)
# remove and adding from the the other end is o(n)
